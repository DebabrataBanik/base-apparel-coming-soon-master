### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS Grid, creating grid layouts to position sections based on the design. 
Using ```ch``` unit in ```<p>``` tag to limit the width of the text.

### Continued development

Improving the form interactivity to only display the error message when the form is submitted. And when the user edits the input, the error message should disappear. 
Also implement the same project using React framework.
